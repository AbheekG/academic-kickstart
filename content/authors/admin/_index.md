I am a second-year MS student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.utexas.edu/) at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/). Before joining UT, I was an undergrad at the [Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati](https://www.iitg.ac.in/), where I majored in [Mathematics and Computing](http://www.iitg.ac.in/maths/acads/btech_struct.php). <!-- I hope to start my Ph.D. next fall. -->

I am interested in theoretical computer science and applied mathematics, particularly algorithms, optimization, learning theory, and their application to economics.
